> **A comprehensive framework for Causal Machine Learning with continuous treatments, designed for real-world industrial applications.**

This repository implements the methodology described in our KDD 2025 paper: *"An end-to-end pipeline for Causal ML with continuous treatments: An application to financial decision making"*. The framework addresses critical challenges in applying causal inference to industrial-scale problems, including high dimensionality, positivity assumption violations, and continuous treatment effects.

## üéØ Key Contributions

- **Positivity Assumption Violation Handling**: Framework to detect and quantify positivity violations in continuous treatment settings + different remediation strategies suggestions.
- **Scalable Dimensionality Reduction**: Two-stage selection framework specifically designed for causal inference with high-dimensional data.
- **Continuous Treatment Adaptations**: Extension of sensitivity analysis and estimation methods from binary to continuous treatments.
- **End-to-End Integration**: Complete modular workflow bridging the gap between academic theory and practical implementation.

## üîß Problem Statement

Traditional causal inference methods face significant limitations in industrial applications:

- **High dimensionality** in modern datasets creates computational and statistical challenges
- **Continuous treatments** are common in practice but poorly supported by existing tools
- **Positivity violations** occur frequently when human decision-making limits treatment exposure
- **Limited toolkits** provide comprehensive end-to-end solutions for real-world scenarios

Our paper specifically addresses these challenges in the context of **financial debt collection**, where the goal is to determine optimal write-down percentages to maximize recovery while minimizing loss.

## üèóÔ∏è Pipeline Architecture

The framework consists of six sequential, modular steps:

### 1. **Dimensionality Reduction**
**Challenge**: High-dimensional observational data introduces computational complexity for causal discovery algorithms and iterative refinement with expert-knowledge.

**Solution**: Two-stage feature selection framework:
- **Stage 1**: Treatment-predictive feature selection using hybrid FCBF + Sequential Forward Selection
- **Stage 2**: Dual partial correlation analysis for confounder and outcome predictor identification

**Output**: Reduced adjustment set $Z = Z_T \cup Z_Y$ maintaining causal validity

### 2. **Causal Identification**
**Challenge**: Algorithmic causal discovery alone is insufficient for reliable causal graph construction.

**Solution**: Hybrid approach combining:
- **Algorithmic discovery**: Ensemble of PC, FCI, and GES algorithms
- **Domain expertise**: Iterative refinement through expert validation
- **Temporal constraints**: Enforcement of known variable orderings

**Output**: Expert-validated causal graph and final adjustment set

### 3. **Positivity Assumption Violation Handling**
**Challenge**: Systematic violations of positivity assumption in observational data.

**Solution**: Three-step model-agnostic procedure:
- **Detection**: Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) based violation quantification
- **Quantification**: Continuous severity measures across treatment space
- **Remediation**: Domain-informed data augmentation strategies

**Output**: Augmented dataset with improved treatment overlap

### 4. **Effect Estimation**
**Challenge**: Standard estimators designed for binary treatments poorly handle continuous interventions.

**Solution**: Benchmarking of three approaches:
- **Linear regression with interactions**: Interpretable baseline
- **S-learner**: Flexible single-model approach with regularization
- **Modified AIPTW**: Doubly-robust estimation adapted for continuous treatments

**Output**: Individual dose-response curves and treatment effect estimates

### 5. **Refutation and Evaluation**
**Challenge**: Validating causal estimates without ground truth.

**Solution**: Comprehensive validation framework:
- **Placebo tests**: Treatment replacement to verify effect attribution
- **Random common cause tests**: Stability assessment via synthetic confounders
- **E-value sensitivity analysis**: Potential unmeasured confounding quantification for continuous treatments
- **Qini curves**: Uplift-oriented performance evaluation

**Output**: Validated estimates with robustness metrics and final estimate selection

### 6. **Policy Optimization**
**Challenge**: Translating causal estimates into actionable business decisions.

**Solution**: Counterfactual-driven optimization:
- **Individual treatment recommendations**: Personalized optimal write-down levels
- **Expected value calculations**: Cost-benefit analysis integration
- **Policy simulation**: Risk assessment under different intervention strategies

**Output**: Optimized treatment policies and decision support tools
